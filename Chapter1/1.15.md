a) 5 times:

	   (sine 12.15)
	-> (p (sine 4.05))
	-> (p (p (sine 1.35)))
	-> (p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
	-> (p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
	-> (p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
	
b) The variable `a` divides by `3.0` each time, until it is smaller than `0.1`. So:

	   a / (3.0) ^ O(a) <= 0.1
	-> 10 * a <= 3 ^ O(a)
	-> log (10 * a) / log 3 <= O(a)

It means, the steps count at least to be `log (10 * a) / log 3`, as having `O(log(x))` order of growth.
